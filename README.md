# Body-Composition-Analysis

I've got data that contains my nutritional macros, body weight and composition, exercise information and more. I'd like to see if I can reject/fail to reject these hypotheses:

Potential hypotheses:
- Eating in a calorie surplus means more muscle growth
- Exercising doesn't burn any additional calories
  - It is my hypothesis that exercise doesn't burn any calories beyond the base rate
    - Eg: If I need 3000 calories per day to maintain my weight, doing exercise to burn 500 calories won't result in a net calorie deficit
      - In this scenario, if exercising did burn calories, I would expect the net calories for the day to be 2500

### Data Sources
##### MyFitnessPal
I've logged what I have eaten each day with a high degree of accuracy. 
- I try to log all snacks I have and down to the number of sweets that I might have. 
- On nights out I look back through receipts or try and estimate what drinks I drank to add to MyFitnessPal

##### Body Weight
I have tracked my body weight, BMI, Body Fat %, Muscle %, Visceral Fat % and RMI using Omron's BF508.
- All of these stats are estimated, however I have used the same set of scales throughout. Some data is missing, which I will fill with estimated values

##### Exercise Information
Apple Health - All recorded workout data will be in Apple Health<br>
Manual Imports - For the first year+ of working out, I only recorded a paper copy of my exercises/weight/reps. I need to digitise these<br>
Strong App - Workout data from September 2024 is recorded using the Strong App<br>
Strava - All running data will be on Strava. *if it's not on Strava, you haven't done it*<br>
Garmin - Recent running data is primarily recorded and logged first on Garmin, then sent to Strava for additional logging
